## 1. Motivation

This repository contains the code for the implementation of the node regression tasks on dynamic temporal graphs.

We tend to perform comparative analysis on different Temporal graph neural network (TGNNs) models using the England Covid 19 dataset. 

## 2. Environment

- Python 3.8.0
- PyTorch 2.0.*
- CUDA 11.7
- PyTorch Geometric Temporal (ref: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html)

Prepare the anaconda environment:

```bash
conda create -n tg python=3.8.0
conda activate tg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
